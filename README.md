# VBA-challenge

I created a VBA Script that tracks each type of stock.
The script I used will also calculate the total stock volume for each stock as well as the yearly change and percent change.
The yearly change has been color conditioned to make it easier to see if the yearly change was positive or negative.
If the stock yearly change was positive it will be green and if negative it will be red.


I tested this script on the alphabetic testing before using on the Multiple_Year_Stock_Data file. 
I uploaded photos of my results for each year, 2014, 2015, and 2016.
